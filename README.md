# Spotify ETL Pipeline

The purpose of this project was to build familiarity with the technical skills needed to build an ETL pipeline. The inspiration for this project came from https://github.com/sidharth1805.  Thank you also to the reddit r/dataengineering community for building the wiki through which I was able to find Sidharths work.

This respository contains all files needed to build a ETL pipeline for recently played songs from Spotify. To get it to work you will need to do the following:
1. Create a developer account on Spotify through which to request API tokens
2. Create your own .env file and save it the same working directory as the files here
3. Create your own Amazon RDS account, database instance and database (or any other database endpoint).
